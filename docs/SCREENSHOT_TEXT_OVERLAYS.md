## Design Tips

1. **Keep it concise** - Users scan quickly, so keep text short
2. **High contrast** - Ensure text is readable against the screenshot background
3. **Consistent style** - Use the same font, size, and color scheme across all screenshots
4. **Don't overcrowd** - Leave space for the actual app content to show
5. **Match app theme** - Use colors that match your app (dark blue, light blue accents)
