## Updated Text for "Any other information required to access your app"

Since you're using **email/password login only** (no Google/GitHub), use this text:

---

**Copy and paste this into the form:**

```
CodeVerse requires sign-in to access features. Reviewers can:

1. Sign up with email: Create a new account using any email address. No email verification is required for testing purposes.

2. Or use magic link: Enter your email on the login screen and tap "Use magic link instead" to receive a passwordless sign-in link via email.

The app supports email/password authentication and passwordless magic link login. Reviewers can create a test account instantly with any email address.
```

**Character count:** ~280 / 500 characters

## Alternative Shorter Version (if needed)

If you need a shorter version:

```
CodeVerse requires email sign-in. Reviewers can create a new account with any email address (no verification required). Alternatively, use the "magic link" option on the login screen for passwordless access.
```

**Character count:** ~165 / 500 characters

## What This Tells Reviewers

1. ✅ They can create a new account with any email
2. ✅ No email verification needed (makes testing easier)
3. ✅ Magic link option available (passwordless)
4. ✅ No mention of Google/GitHub (since you don't use them)

## Important Notes

- **Don't check** "No other information is required" (since sign-in IS required)
- Make sure your backend allows account creation without email verification for testing
- Reviewers will be able to test all features after creating an account
